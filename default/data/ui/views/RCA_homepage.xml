      <h1>Root Cause Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Root cause analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving used for identifying the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is considered a root cause if removal thereof from the problem-fault-sequence prevents the final undesirable event from recurring; whereas a causal factor is one that affects an event's outcome, but is not a root cause. Though removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence within certainty.  
Customer bug root cause analysis will help QA to better know how to find those bugs earlier or even help development team prevent those bugs happen by removing the problem's cause.
