      <h1>Root Cause Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Root cause analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving used for identifying the root causes of faults or problems.  Customer bug root cause analysis will help QA to better understand how end user uses our product better and find out where to find out the bugs before end user or even help the development team to think how to prevent the bugs happen from software development lifecycle.
